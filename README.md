# Sails PostgreSQL Redacted

This tracks [Sails PostgreSQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-postgresql), with the following changes:

* leaking of database passwords into logs is fixed (https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/4595, https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/4606)
* connecting to databases via unix socket is fixed (https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/6888)

Versions track upstream, with an extra `-{increment}`.
