# Sails PostgreSQL Redacted

A [Waterline](http://waterlinejs.org) adapter for working with the PostgreSQL database.

This tracks [Sails PostgreSQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-postgresql), with the following changes:

* `-{increment}` is appended to the upstream version number that this was forked from
* leaking of database passwords into logs is fixed (https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/4595, https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/4606)
